    <p><b>Night Sky</b> is a simulation software to generate a night sky, <i>i.e.</i> star locations for use in other games.  The stellar distribution can be exported as a DXF
    (Drawing eXchange Format), a common format for use with other drawing programs.  This does allow customization after the generation is complete.  In addition the generation
    data can be save in a comman-deliminated format (as well as reloaded into the program).</p>
