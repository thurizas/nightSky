        There are three steps that are used to generate and display the star field
        <ol>
            <li>Determine the size of the region of space around the planet to simulate, along with the density of stars in the region</li>
            <li>
                Once the number of stars are determined, generate that number of stars, the importaint parameter is the type of star (O,B,A,F,G,K,M)
                the other parameters (radius, mass, lumonsity) can be calculate from the type.  The position of the star is calculated by generating
                a random point inside the sphere define in step 1.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the stars have be generted, they are projected onto the surface of a sphere and then converted into a map - either using the
                Mollweide or an Orthrographic project.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Size of the simulation</h2>
    <p>
        Two parameters control the size, and hence the number of stars generated, these are the radius and density.  These can be set on the configuration
        dialog by using the "radius of space", and the "stellar density" fields respectively.  Note that the radius is given in parsecs and the density is
        in units of stars per parsec.
    </p>
    <p>
        The estimate of 0.130262 star per cubic parsec (the defalut value), represent the value around earth.  If we set the radius to be 20 py, we would
        generate a total of 4,365 stars
    </p>

    <h2>Generation of star properties</h2>
    <p> The first step is to determine the type of the star. We only consider main-sequence stars here, and the distribution of the stars is given by</p>
    <table>
        <tr><td>class</td><td>frequency</td><td>mass, solar masses</td><td>notes</td></tr>
        <tr><td>O </td><td>0.00003  </td><td>   < 16     </td><td>slight underestimate of type O stars</td></tr>
        <tr><td>B </td><td>0.13000  </td><td> 2.1 - 16   </td><td></td></tr>
        <tr><td>A </td><td>0.60000  </td><td> 1.40 - 2.10</td><td></td></tr>
        <tr><td>F </td><td>3.00000  </td><td> 1.04 - 1.40</td><td></td></tr>
        <tr><td>G </td><td>7.60000  </td><td> 0.80 - 1.04</td><td></td></tr>
        <tr><td>K </td><td>12.10000 </td><td> 0.45 - 0.80</td><td></td></tr>
        <tr><td>M </td><td>76.45000 </td><td> 0.08 - 0.45</td><td></td></tr>
    </table>
    <p> Note that only F,G, and K stars are believe to allow humanoid live to evolve.</p>
    <p>
        as mentioned above, we are only considering main-sequence stars, this means we are ignoring supergiant, giant and white dwarfs.  However, their
        estimated density is 96 white dwarfs and four giant/supergiant per 1000 stars
    </p>
    <p> Once we have the stellar type we calculate the stellar mass.  We do this by picking a number, by linear interpolation, between the limits given in the above table</p>
    <p>
        With the stars mass, we can now calculate the other properties that we need.  First is the radius which is given by
        M^{0.5} if the mass is greater than the sun
        R = M^{0.8} if the mass is less than the sun
    </p>
    <p> Finally, we can can calculate the luminosity, or brightness, from L = M^{3.5}.</p>
    <p> Once that stars details are determined, a location is randomly determined.</p>


    <h3>example</h3>
    Suppose that we are generating a star, the folloiwng steps are preformed,
    <ol>
        <li> A type is seleced, for example lets assume that we have a type G star</li>
        <li>
            Refering to the above table, the mass is between 0.80 and 1.04 solar masses, a range of 0.24.  We generate a random number between 1 and 100, say 47, and us this as a percentage of the
            range.  Thus the mass of the star is 0.80 + 0.47*(1.04-0.80) =  0.913.  Or about 91.3% of the suns mass.
        </li>
        <li> Given that the mass is less that the sun, the radius is given by R = M^{0.8} = 0.913^{0.8} = 0.930, or about 93% of the suns size.</li>
        <li> With the mass, we can calculate the luminosity, from L = M^{3.5} = (0.930)^{3.5} = 0.775, or about 77.5% as bright as the sun.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Mapping</h2>
    Once the positions are determined, all the stars are projected onto a spherial shell set some distance from the planet (think of a planetarium dome).  This is done by setting the radius
    component of each star to a constant value.  This value is determeind by the paramter "Radius of Projetion" on the configuration dialog.  While on the configuation dialog, the projection
    can be choosen as well if a grid (and the spacing for latatiude and longitude) should be shown can be configured.
